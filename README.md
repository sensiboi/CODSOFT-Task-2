# CODSOFT - Task 2 - Sales Prediction

This repository contains the Sales Prediction project developed by Suvranil Saha for a data science internship at CodSoft. The project involves predicting sales based on advertising data using linear regression.

## Project Description

The Sales Prediction project uses linear regression to predict sales based on the advertising budget spent on TV, radio, and newspapers. The dataset contains information on the advertising budget and the corresponding sales figures for a product.

## Code and Data

### Code

The main code is contained in the [`Sales Prediction.ipynb`](https://github.com/sensiboi/CODSOFT-Task-2/blob/main/Sales_Prediction.ipynb) Jupyter Notebook. It includes the following steps:

1. Importing Libraries
2. Loading the Dataset
3. Data Exploration and Visualization
4. Training the Model with Linear Regression
5. Testing the Model
6. Visualizing the Results

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the advertising dataset, which consists of 200 samples with the following features:
- TV: Advertising budget spent on TV
- Radio: Advertising budget spent on Radio
- Newspaper: Advertising budget spent on Newspapers
- Sales: Sales of the product
